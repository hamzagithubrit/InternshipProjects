    <br>  We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks <br> to the tireless efforts of folk like the <span class="word2">W3C</span>, <span class="word2">WaSP</span>, and the major browser creators.</p>

        <td class="p6">There is a continuing need to show the power of <br> <span class="word2">CSS</span>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire,<br> and encourage participation. To begin, view <br>some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking <br>on any one will load the style sheet into this very <br>page. The <span class="word2">HTML</span> remains the same, the only <br> thing that has changed is the external CSS file. <br> Yes, really. <br>
  
          <span class="word2">CSS</span> allows complete and total control over the <br> style of a hypertext document. The only way this <br> can be illustrated in a way that gets people  <br>excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be,<br> once the reins are placed in the hands of those <br> able to create beauty from structure. Designers <br> and coders alike have contributed to the beauty <br> of the web; we can always push it further.</td>
